Introduction:
The game called "Snake" or "Snake Game" typically involves the player controlling a line or snake, there is no official version of the game, so gameplay varies. The most common version of the game involves the snake or line eating items which make it longer, with the objective being to avoid running into a border or the snake itself for as long as possible. The player loses when the snake either runs into a border or its own body. Because of this, the game becomes more difficult as it goes on, due to the growth of the snake. Nokia has installed the "Snake Game" on many of its phones. The game is also available on several websites, including YouTube, which allows viewers to play the game while a video load
Objective:
This Project in Game is a simple console application with very simple graphics. In this project, you can play the popular "Snake Game" just like you played it elsewhere. You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake. Foods are provided at the several coordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will be increased by one element along with the score. It isn't the world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting games of your own.

Features & About the Project:
●This snake game is just similar to games which are found under the mobile games section. It uses the concept of graphics to display the menu items and all objects on a single screen.
● Players will be able to check their result after games get over in the console.
●The score section will display the total score of the player.
●The object's food position has been set at random, so whenever the player will start the game, the snake will appear at random location every time.
●The snake object will always appear in black color.
● The arrow keys "up, down, left, right" has been set within the program to move the snake to right, left, top and bottom respectively









FUTURE SCOPE  OF THE PROJECT:
Our project will be able to be implemented in future after making some changes and modifications as we make our project at a very low level. So the modifications that can be done in our project are:
1.It can be made with good graphics.
2.We can add more options like Top scores and Player Profile
3.We can add multiplayer option


Functional Requirements:
Mentioned below are Certain conditions that need to be met for the program to be run as intended. 
1. The program needs to be opened in a machine with Python ver. 3.9 or above otherwise the program will not run 
2. The program requires extra libraries which need to be installed using the pip command in CMD or else the program will not run. 
3. Keyboard is required to play the game. 

Python Functions used:
Following are the python functions used in this program
● Library of pygame
● Multiple method declared and used
● Multiple while Loops
● String and Integer as data types
● Stack
●Binary sorting






Computer Graphics:
●Computer Graphics is one of the most powerful and interesting aspects of computers.
●There are many things we can do in graphics apart from drawing figures of various shapes.
●All video games, animation, multimedia predominantly works using computer graphics.

Testing & Screenshots:
Testing is the major control measure used during software development. Its basic function is to detect errors in the software. During requirement analysis and design, the output is a document that is usually textual and not executable. After the coding phase, computer programs are available that can be executed for testing purposes. This implies that testing not only has to uncover errors introduced during coding, but also errors introduced during previous phases. Thus, the goal of testing is to uncover the requirements, design and coding errors in the programs. So, after testing the outputs of my project are as follows:
